# 1876. Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters

## We can use three methods

1. Taking brute force approach to go thru each subarray and then take into count
2. Taking brute force and taking into account if three elements are inequal (brute force because can be applied on only this question not any variants)
3. Use Sliding window(fixed)
