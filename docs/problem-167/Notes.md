# 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

- [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/description/)
This solution is an extension to the two sum problem and hence the [two sum](../problem-1/) solutions can be applied here too.As here the array is sorted hence binary search or the other approaches in like two pointers make sense.

- [Brute force](../problem-1/file-brute.cpp) and  [hashmap approach](../problem-1/file-optimised.cpp) in two sum can be applied here too.
